# Commitment Project
## What is it?
This project is an assignment in which I had to have at least 100 commits to github and create a website using a lot of different CSS.

## What did I do for this?
For this project, I decided to make it frog themed. My friend Lauren has an insane collection of frog pictures that I thought could be useful for this proejct.

## How did you make this project?
In order to create this website, I used a variety of websites to help me. Specifically
- CSS-Tricks
- Google Fonts
- W3 Schools
